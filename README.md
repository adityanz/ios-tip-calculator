# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Aditya Dixit**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I ended up adding a small message based on the percentage selected to give a nice feedback for the tip being provided.

I also added a launch screen and a logo and based the colors of the app on my current university.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This was the first time for me that I was develping in iOS and really the biggest challenge I had was trying to understand how the whole interface worked while at the same time trying to see what is going wrong and debugging. I had to figure outt the new syntax, like referring to the data in the objects, and also understanding how view did load works and how the variable linkage to the storyboard happens. Overall, I think I really enjoyed my iOS experience and I cannot wait to learn more.
